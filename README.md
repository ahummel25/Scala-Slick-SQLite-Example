# Scala-Slick-SQLite-Example
I have found that the Slick documentation is very sparse when it comes to writing a Slick application capable of creating and populating a SQLite database. This is a fully worked example with the build.sbt file and appropriate database configuration for a SQLite database.

The following example usese Slick 3.3.0 and sbt 1.2.8

More notes to be added...
